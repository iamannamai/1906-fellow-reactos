# How To REACTO

You know the drill. Get to it. But in case you're looking for how to be a better interviewer/interviewee, read on for tips taken from CtCI and the FS Tech Interview Repo.

- **R** - Repeat
- **E** - Example
- **A** - Approach
- **C** - Code
- **T** - Test
- **O** - Optimize

## Interviewee

- Prompts are often kept intentionally vague, so ASK. QUESTIONS.
- Simplify the problem.
- Work through an example.
- State your brute force approach.
- Break the problem down. You can modularize your code to make concepts easier to follow!
- Optimize and talk about your space and time complexity.

## Interviewer

- Keep your prompts vague so that your interviewer is encouraged to ask questions. Unless the prompt states explicitly, we can keep specs hidden until they ask: _Will there be duplicates? Is the array sorted? Etc..._
- Come prepared! Understand the flow of logic so that you can help your partner along.
- Make sure you understand their plan of action before they start coding so they don't end up wasting too much of their time with an approach that likely won't work.

## Both

- Take some time afterward to summarize key concepts/strategies used during the REACTO to really reinforce the patterns seen.
