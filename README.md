# 1906 Fellows Algos Schedule

## Resources

- Refer to the [CtCI JS repo](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript) for solutions to additional problems
- [CtCI ES2015](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript-ES2015) for most up-to-date syntax
- Solutions can also sometimes be found in the [FSA Technical Interview Prep Repo](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/technical-interview-prep/)

## Practicing Algos

- **REACTOS** - Pairs can be assigned each week, but the pair can self organize around _when_ they want to do their REACTOS. Questions are provided as starting points.
  - _Suggestion_: Interviewers can create gists in preparation of walking through questions with their interviewees. These gists can look like the REACTOs delivered in Senior Phase, but at minimum should probably include:
    - Question
    - Examples/Test Cases
    - Hints (taken from CtCI, or provided)
    - At least one solution
    - Explanations of code
- **MOBBING** - Also provided are suggestions of questions to mob program together. Mobbing groups can self-organize based on REACTO pairs. We're taking a loose definition of mobbing, so we can decide the rules of engagement, but to start:
  - Everyone gets an understanding of the question
  - Anyone can pitch in with an approach
  - One driver (whiteboarder) at a time, switching off after 5 - 10min

## Schedule

### Week 1: Arrays and Strings

<details>

#### REACTOS

- 1.5: One Away (aka simpler Levenshtein Distance)
  <details>
  There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
  - Solutions:
    - [CtCI JS](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript/blob/master/chapter01/1.5%20-%20OneAway/oneAway.js)
    - [CtCI ES2015](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript-ES2015/blob/master/src/chapter1/ch1-q5.js)
  - Gists:
    - N/A
    <details><summary>Hints</summary>
      - #23: Start with the easy thing. Can you check each of the conditions separately?
      - #97: What is the relationship between "insert" and "remove"? Do they need to be two separate checks?
      - #130: Can you do all three checks in a single pass?
    </details>
  </details>
- 1.7 Rotate Matrix (aka Rotate Image)
  <details>
  Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
  - Solutions:
    - [CtCI JS](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript/blob/master/chapter01/1.7%20-%20Rotate%20Matrix/rotateMatrix.js)
    - [CtCI ES2015](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript-ES2015/blob/master/src/chapter1/ch1-q7.js)
  - Gists:
    - N/A
    <details><summary>Hints</summary>
      - #51: Try thinking about it layer by layer. Can you rotate a specific layer?
      - #100: Rotating a layer means swapping the layer in 4 arrays. Could you swap the values in 2 arrays? Could you extend this to 4?
    </details>
  </details>
- 1.9 String Rotation
  <details>
  There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

  - Gists:
    - N/A
    <details><summary>Hints</summary>
      - #104: Think about the earlier hint. Then think about what happens when you concatenate `erbottlewat` to itself.
