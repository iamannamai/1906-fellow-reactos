# 1.5 One Away

---

## Question

Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away from each other. An edit can be any of the following operations:

- insert a character
- remove a character
- replace a character

---

## Example Output

```javascript
oneAway('pale', 'ple'); // true
oneAway('pales', 'pale'); // true
oneAway('pale', 'bale'); // true
oneAway('pale', 'bake'); // false
```

## Hints

<details>

- #23: Start with the easy thing. Can you check each of the conditions separately?
- #97: What is the relationship between "insert" and "remove"? Do they need to be two separate checks?
- #130: Can you do all three checks in a single pass?

</details>

## Solution and Explanation (a)

### Approach

This particular question is a string traversal problem that _keeps track of differences encountered in a variable_ (either a counter or a boolean flag would work). The solution below loosely uses a _pointer pattern_,continually traversing through the longer string while incrementing the pointer for the shorter string only if one of the following conditions are satisfied:

- the characters at the pointers' indices match, moving both pointers along to check the next character
- OR, if the characters don't match, the two strings are of equal length (assuming that the encounter signifies that an edit should be made)

In the remaining scenario, where the characters at the current pointers don't match and the strings are not of equal length, we assume an insert or delete must be made into the shorter string and only increment the pointer to the longer string (continue traversing the for loop).

### Complexity

**Time Complexity** for this function is `O(N)`. Since we perform a check in the beginning on string lengths, whether N denotes the longer or shorter string is not _too_ relevant, but we can call N the length of the longer string to be more specific.

**Space Complexity** for this function is `O(1)`. Note that while the below solution declares variables to store the longer and shorter strings for easy reference, but there are ways to get around that.

## Solution Code

```javascript
// Solution code goes here
function oneAway(s1, s2) {
  if (Math.abs(s1.length - s2.length > 2)) return false;

  const shorter = s1.length < s2.length ? s1 : s2;
  const longer = s1.length < s2.length ? s2 : s1;

  let edits = 0;
  let shorterPoint = 0;

  // traverse through longer string, keep track of pointer for shorter
  for (let i = 0; i < longer.length; i++) {
    if (shorter[shorterPoint] === longer[i]) {
      shorterPoint++;
    } else {
      edits++;
      if (shorter.length === longer.length) shorterPoint++;
    }
    if (edits > 1) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

**Key Patterns**

- pointers
- flagging edits
